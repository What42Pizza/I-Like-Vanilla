What42's Shader License 2.1
Effective Date: 2025-08-15



Overview: (informal and not legally binding)

You can:
- Use this for Minecraft gameplay
- Use this for creating screenshots, YouTube videos, etc.
- Use this in modpacks (with restrictions)
- Create private modifications (without any restrictions)
- Create public modifications (with restrictions)
- Use parts of this shader in other shaders or projects (with restrictions)
- Copy parts / all of this license (without any restrictions)

You cannot:
- Use any of this shader in ways not explicitly allowed by this license (without any exceptions)

Notes:
- Making changes to the code isn't strictly required for publishing altered versions of this shader; a significant enough change to the default settings (for each style) is enough to count (as defined by section 2.3.3)
- Regarding forks of this shader, only the license(s) of the base shaderpack(s) affect the fork's dev, and not the license of the fork. Also, you only have to follow the version of the license that came with the latest version that you forked
- This license can apply to distributions of this shader (downloaded from curseforge, modrinth, etc) and apply separately to a download of this shader's repo. That means the images, Rust code, and everything else in this shader's full repo is also protected by this license
- If you're sure that what you're doing is allowed by this license, there's no need to ask for permission. And if you're unsure of whether what you're doing is allowed by this license, feel free to ask

No one person holds the copyright for all of the contents of this shader. Full credits can be found in the file 'readme.md'.
If you feel that your copyrights have been violated, please contact all parties involved to have your work removed or to have the situation otherwise corrected.
This license was created for the shaderpack I Like Vanilla. The developer (for both) goes by "What42" / "What42Pizza" online, and you can contact him on Discord at "what42pizza" / "What42Pizza#0283" or by email at "burg.what42@gmail.com".
