Before 1.0.0:
Add 'dither or noise' options to everything that uses dithering or noise
Make sure ALL settings work
Make sure that ALL settings are listed in the same order in define_settings.glsl, shaders.properties, and the style files
Rework clouds
Rework sky
Make nearby cloud transparency more smooth
Make sure all vanilla effect work
Update ALL gallery images
Update performance and compatibility note (Note: This shader is only tested with a GTX 1070 on Windows and mainly on Iris 1.21.1 and (occasionally) Optifine 1.12.2. I can average up to 100 fps with Fabulously Optimized + Distant Horizons + 16 Chunks + 1080p + Medium preset.)
Maybe add smaa from https://github.com/Luracasmus/smaa-mc
Add a scary style?
Add generalized volumetrics
Re-add BLOCKS_REFLECTION_AMOUNT_MULT_SURFACE?
Fix rain reflections
Check if SUNRAYS_FLICKERING_FIX is still needed
Re-add SHOW_DANGEROUS_LIGHT



Planned 1.0.0 pipeline: (if rendering at half-res works out)

- render opaques
- render deferred
- - render shadows and ssao at half resolution
- - apply lighting
- render transparents
- render composite
- - combine opaques, transparents, and volumetrics, apply auto exposure, and filter bloom
- - render reflections and bloom at half resolution
- - add reflections and bloom and do aa
- - process underwater waving and do depth of field and motion blur
- - do sharpening, color correction, etc

MAYBE, half-res textures can be rendered without rendering edge data, then an upscaling pass can for each 2x2 quad either upscale the half-ref texture or else render at full ref?



Current:
Make more example images:
	Rain
	Night
	Reflections
Make sunrays cave increase ignore sunrays max
Add water caustics?
Increase waviness of plant tops
Move the moonLightBrightness calculation in basic_lighting to its own uniform
Turn uniforms into "static" vars?
Do a round of making sure different settings combinations work
Improve TAA on moving entities
Add documentation for super secret settings
Rework sky
Make only top of water wavy
Add ripples to rain reflections
Add void fog option?
Add shader seasons?
Add settings for manually disabling composite files?
Add backwards depth check to reflections?
Make reflections work with isometric rendering
Move advanced options to 'advanced options' menus
Add more TAA settings
Add setting to fade fog into sky buffer (to make the sun and moon appear in fog) (would also need sunray depth fix)
Do a round of general optimizations
Exclude sun, moon, and sunrays based on horizon multiplier
Do a round of adding debug settings
Do a round of adding more ways to get to options (e.g. access to light brightnesses from the 'shading' menu)
Switch to Contrast Adaptive Sharpening?
Fix ssao causing desaturation on sand?
Test glsl optimizer (https://github.com/aras-p/glsl-optimizer)
Find a way to stop sugar cane base from waving?
Determine performance costs



Ongoing / continuous:
OPTIMIZE (see shader assembly?)
Keep the shader simple!
Update documentation
Cut down on the number of options
Add more values to options
Add more comments to options
Match the vanilla look, especially in:
	night
	underwater
	nether
	end
	caves
	rain
