Todo for v1.0:
Re-add NEARBY_PARTICLE_TRANSPARENCY functionality
Make sure dh terrain looks just like regular terrain
Add in-liquid alterations for atmospheric fog
Update ALL gallery images
Update performance and compatibility note (and make sure it is true in all / most cases) ("Note: This shader is only tested with a GTX 1070 on Windows and mainly on Iris 1.21.1 and (occasionally) Optifine 1.12.2. I can average up to 100 fps with Fabulously Optimized + Distant Horizons + 16 Chunks + 1080p + Medium preset.")
Fix rain reflections
Make sure it works with optifine
Make sure ALL settings work
Make sure settings are tuned for:
	Vanilla + Fantasy + Realistic + Cartoon
	* Day + Night + Sunrise + Sunset + Nether + End
	* Raining + dry
	Especially settings:
		BLOCK_REFLECTION_AMOUNT_SURFACE
		BLOCK_REFLECTION_AMOUNT_UNDERGROUND



Planned for next version:
Update documentation
Fix far-away reflections
Add setting 'Shadows on Transparents'
Make sure all vanilla effect work
Add specular reflections? (should be encoded in block ids)
Separate depth sunrays and vol sunrays settings
Add settings for temporal filter



Other planned:
Add 'dither or noise' options to everything that uses dithering or noise (maybe not idk)
turn betterNightVision into a uniform
Change data buffers to store ints instead of floats?
Add settings for nether ambient color
Add setting 'Bright Terrain Decrease' (for smoothMin value)
Add generalized volumetrics?
Make reflections (especially on water) noticeable at night
Increase waviness of plant tops
Add setting `Light Mixing: Artistic / Realistic`
Check if SUNRAYS_FLICKERING_FIX is still needed
Check gamma correction stuff again to make sure it makes sense
Add a scary style?
Test `blend.<program>.<buffer>=<off|src dst srcA dstA>` in shader.properties
Maybe add smaa from https://github.com/Luracasmus/smaa-mc
Rework outline detection to use normals instead of depth?
World curvature settings
Add water caustics?
Do a round of making sure different settings combinations work
Improve TAA on moving entities
Add documentation for super secret settings
Make only top of water wavy
Add ripples to rain reflections
Add void fog option?
Add shader seasons?
Add backwards depth check to reflections?
Make reflections work with isometric rendering
Move advanced options to 'advanced options' menus
Exclude sun, moon, and sunrays based on horizon multiplier
Do a round of adding debug settings
Do a round of adding more ways to get to options (e.g. access to light brightnesses from the 'shading' menu)
Fix ssao causing desaturation on sand?
Test glsl optimizer (https://github.com/aras-p/glsl-optimizer)
Find a way to stop sugar cane base from waving?
Determine performance costs



Ongoing / continuous:
OPTIMIZE (see shader assembly?)
Update documentation
Keep the shader simple!
Cut down on the number of options
Add more values to options (to an extent)
Add more comments to options
Make sure all styles look good in:
	day
	night
	sunset
	sunrise
	underwater
	nether
