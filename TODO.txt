Before 1.0.0:
Improve cloud lighting
Fix hand reprojection
Add settings for nether ambient color
Add specular reflections? (should be encoded in block ids)
Make volumetric sunrays work over dh terrain again
Add 'dither or noise' options to everything that uses dithering or noise (maybe not idk)
Add setting 'Bright Terrain Decrease' (for smoothMin value)
Make sure ALL settings work
Make dh terrain look like regular terrain
Update ALL gallery images
Update performance and compatibility note (and make sure it is true in all / most cases) ("Note: This shader is only tested with a GTX 1070 on Windows and mainly on Iris 1.21.1 and (occasionally) Optifine 1.12.2. I can average up to 100 fps with Fabulously Optimized + Distant Horizons + 16 Chunks + 1080p + Medium preset.")
Fix rain reflections
Go through and make sure that all `#include`s are used or removed
Fix in-liquid fog
Make sure it works with optifine
Make sure settings are tuned for:
	Vanilla Day
	Vanilla Night
	Vanilla Sunrise
	Vanilla Sunset
	Realistic Day
	Realistic Night
	Realistic Sunrise
	Realistic Sunset
	Fantasy Day
	Fantasy Night
	Fantasy Sunrise
	Fantasy Sunset
	Cartoon Day
	Cartoon Night
	Cartoon Sunrise
	Cartoon Sunset
	Especially settings:
		BLOCK_REFLECTION_AMOUNT_SURFACE
		BLOCK_REFLECTION_AMOUNT_UNDERGROUND
Update documentation

Possibly before 1.0.0:
Make sure all vanilla effect work
Change data buffers to store ints instead of floats?
Add setting 'Shadows on Transparents'
Add generalized volumetrics
Make reflections (especially on water) noticeable at night
Add settings for TAA
Add setting `Light Mixing: Artistic / Realistic`
Add close-up particle reduction
Check if SUNRAYS_FLICKERING_FIX is still needed
Separate depth sunrays and vol sunrays settings
Check gamma correction stuff again to make sure it makes sense
Add a scary style?
Rework sky
Maybe add smaa from https://github.com/Luracasmus/smaa-mc
Test `blend.<program>.<buffer>=<off|src dst srcA dstA>` in shader.properties
Rework outline detection to use normals instead of depth?



Current:
Make more example images:
	Rain
	Night
	Reflections
See if `depthIsSky()` can take non-linear values
Increase waviness of plant tops
World curvature settings
Make sunrays cave increase ignore sunrays max
Add water caustics?
Move the moonLightBrightness calculation in basic_lighting to its own uniform
Turn uniforms into "static" vars?
Do a round of making sure different settings combinations work
Improve TAA on moving entities
Add documentation for super secret settings
Make only top of water wavy
Add ripples to rain reflections
Add void fog option?
Add shader seasons?
Add settings for manually disabling composite files?
Add backwards depth check to reflections?
Make reflections work with isometric rendering
Move advanced options to 'advanced options' menus
Add more TAA settings
Add setting to fade fog into sky buffer (to make the sun and moon appear in fog) (would also need sunray depth fix)
Do a round of general optimizations
Exclude sun, moon, and sunrays based on horizon multiplier
Do a round of adding debug settings
Do a round of adding more ways to get to options (e.g. access to light brightnesses from the 'shading' menu)
Switch to Contrast Adaptive Sharpening?
Fix ssao causing desaturation on sand?
Test glsl optimizer (https://github.com/aras-p/glsl-optimizer)
Find a way to stop sugar cane base from waving?
Determine performance costs



Ongoing / continuous:
OPTIMIZE (see shader assembly?)
Keep the shader simple!
Update documentation
Cut down on the number of options
Add more values to options (to an extent)
Add more comments to options
Make sure all styles look good in:
	day
	night
	sunset
	sunrise
	underwater
	nether
	end
	caves
	rain
