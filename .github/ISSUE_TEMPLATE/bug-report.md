Before you report:
1: Make sure you're using the latest Shaderpack version and the latest Iris / OptiFine.
2: Check if the problem has already been reported here or Iris's / OptiFine's issue trackers
3: (Bonus) Imagine I respond with something like "Dude how on earth did you forget ___?", and think to yourself, 'what would that blank be?'. This may not be applicable to your situation, but if it does help then you'll be glad you did this



**Describe the bug**
What's wrong and what's supposed to happen instead? Screenshots can be pretty helpful here

**To Reproduce**
When does this occur?

**Context**
Must-include information: F3 screenshot, Minecraft version, Iris / OptiFine version, OS, and basic computer specs

Keep in mind that this is a template, and you can put extra information wherever you want
