## About:

Shaders typically fall into one of two camps: completely overhauling minecraft's style or completely copying it. This shader aims to overhaul the graphics while making it feel like nothing has changed. It's the same style as vanilla minecraft but built for my own preferences, which are:

- Beautiful and Pleasant
- Unobtrusive
- Sharp AA
- Gameplay-Oriented
- Interesting and Exciting
- Performant

### Supports [Voxy](https://modrinth.com/mod/voxy), [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons), [Colorwheel](https://modrinth.com/mod/colorwheel), and more!

## Note: Optifine support will be partially dropped in the next update

<br>

## How to install:

- 1: Install either [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) (full modpack, preferred) or [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris)/[Occulus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus) (single mod, can be added anywhere)
- 2: Download the latest version of this shader
  - (If you want to see the values used by each style, you can download a style-specific version)
- 3: Launch minecraft, go to the shaderpacks menu, and click the 'Open Shader Packs Folder' button
- 4: Put the downloaded shader zip into the shaderpacks folder
- 5: Select the shader within the shaderpacks menu

## Performance Comparisons:

I'm not sure how trustworthy these results are, but it should give you a rough idea of the performance between shaders. Also, you can compare your graphics card to mine [here](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gtx-1070.c2840). Tests:

- No Shaders: >250 fps
- Makeup UltraFast: 170 fps
- RenderPearl: 133 fps
- **I Like Vanilla**: 120 fps (Vanilla style)
- BSL: 106 fps
- **I Like Vanilla**: 93 fps (Fantasy style)
- Photon: 90 fps
- Complementary Reimagined: 76 fps
