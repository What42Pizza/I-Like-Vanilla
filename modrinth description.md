## About:

Shaders typically fall into one of two camps: completely overhauling minecraft's style or completely copying it. This shader aims to overhaul the graphics while making it feel like nothing has changed. I've built this shader according to my own shader preferences, which are:

- Beautiful / Pleasant
- Unobtrusive
- Sharp AA
- Gameplay-Oriented
- Interesting and Exciting
- Performant

<br>

## Installation:

- **Step 1: Choose a version**
- - If using OptiFine **or** if you want to see the default settings, choose an optifine version
- - Otherwise, choose the latest Iris version
- - You can also download the latest development version [here](https://github.com/What42Pizza/I-Like-Vanilla/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- **Step 2: Download and install either [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads) or [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris)**
- **Step 3: From the in-game shaders menu, open the shaders folder and put the downloaded zip file in it** (then select it within the shaders menu)

Note: OptiFine is considered a second-class platform and the majority of development and support is for Iris 1.21+

## Performance Comparisons:

I'm not sure how trustworthy these results are, but it should give you a rough idea of the performance between shaders. Also, you can compare your graphics card to mine [here](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gtx-1070.c2840). Tests:

- No Shaders: >250 fps
- Makeup UltraFast: 170 fps
- RenderPearl: 133 fps
- **I Like Vanilla**: 120 fps (Vanilla style)
- BSL: 106 fps
- **I Like Vanilla**: 93 fps (Fantasy style)
- Photon: 90 fps
- Complementary Reimagined: 76 fps
